        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p align='justify'>I am a software professional who started as a developer in India a few decades ago and worked my way across half the world to my last engagement as an analyst at a pharmaceutical multinational near Brussels, Belgium. With technology exploding all around us in recent times, I am discovering that my years in corporate corridors have not been able to supress my nerdiness and I am being pulled back to my roots - programming. </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Action</h4>
        <p align='justify'>To facilitate this journey back to my programming roots, I started on this challenging technology aquisition drive around October 2015 and has included a fullstack bootcamp at Le Wagon Brussels, books, online courses and countless hours on Stackoverflow. Challenging, because the speed at which technology has evolved had threatened to make a Luddite out of me.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Job Wanted</h4>
        <p align='justify'>I feel I have now reached a point where I will be able to hold my own as an intern or junior developer. I am looking for work at a team where I can continue learning while I am able to contribute at the same time. Some of the skills I have picked up over the past few months are:
          <ul>
            <li> HTML / HAML</li>
            <li> CSS / Bootstrap </li>
            <li> Ruby / Rails </li>
            <li> Javascript / jQuery </li>
            <li> Git </li>

          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Wisdom Factor</h4>
        <p align='justify'>One thing people may wonder about this resume is my age factor. Can someone this 'wise' learn modern technologies?. Oh sure. Consider:
          <ul>
            <li>That I am extremely eager to learn </li>
            <li>That I have plenty of time to immerse myself into learning </li>
            <li> I believe I have the dedication and staying power </li>
            <li> I have seen enough to be convinced about: Honesty, Loyalty, Cooperation and Cordiality </li>
            <li> or ask P.J. O'Roark how <b>'Age and Guile Beat Youth, Innocence, and a Bad Haircut'</b></li>
            <br>
          </ul>
